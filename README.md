The token has:

Let's quote the fineprint from the "Legal FAQ" from a serious / reputable
token sale, that is, Pantos by Bitpanda:

> Pantos - in whatever form â€“ do NOT represent a claim on or against Bitpanda. 
> Bitpanda may decide NOT to exchange Pantos - in whatever form - at ANY time at their sole discretion. 
> [Thanks for the free money and holding the bag!]

_Questions & Answers_

### Q: How do Bitcoins differ from "Platform" Hot Air app tokens? 10-Year-Lottery vs Get-Rich-Quick-Cash-Grab-Token-Sales

Crypto Currency (Bitcoin Accepted Here) vs App "Platform" Tokens

Bitcoins get "mined" with every new block every ten minutes. You CANNOT buy newly minted bitcoins.
The bitcoin "lottery" gives away FREE bitcoins
to the lucky winner / number every ten minutes with every block added for the next TEN YEARS.

Why a lottery? A random (secure) lottery - using the famous proof-of-work hashing crypto "puzzle" -
is the fairest distribution between all network nodes / peers / players.

vs


App tokens do NOT get mined. You can create / mint as many tokens as you like!
Just punch / type in a number - lets say two billion. 
Sell off 30% in an "initial coin offering" (ICO) / token sales to greater fools
in a free money get-rich-quick cash grab running for lets say two or three weeks
and keep the rest "in reserve" for yourself.

It's that easy and with the ready-to-use/ready-to-run Ethereum blockchain / network
you're off in ten minutes! 

Free easy money! Buyer beware! Do NOT get scammed by the promise of returns of 50 000% on your "investment" 
and the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the next bitcoin.
